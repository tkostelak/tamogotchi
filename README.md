# Tamogotchi

### Node, Jquery and Javascript Exercise for Epicodus, 03/21/2018
### By Tyler Kostelak, and Dillon Titcomb.

## Description
_This project is an exploration of Javascript features SetTimeout and SetInterval, which is implemented on a tried and true classic: the Tamogotchi._

## Specifications

### Behavior Driven Development

1. First, the tamogotchi should be able to lose health over time.

2. Next, if the Tamogotchi loses all of its health, it should die and the user should be notified.

3. After the previous behavior is functional, the user should then be able to press a button that restores health to the Tamogotchi, so that it doesn't die.
